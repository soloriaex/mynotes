## Week 3
- ### Structure of Text
  - Text Structure
    - Historical Context: Typewritting, Ancient Text with commentary 
    - Modern Examples: Newspaper
  - Key Concepts
    - Lines and Indentation
    - Paragraphs
  - Markup Languages
    - MarkDown
      - Simples Syntax for formatting
      - Titles: #, ##
      - Italic: _italic_
      - Bold: **Bold** [** bold **}
      - Lists *   item or -item
    - HTML
      - more verbose than MarkDown
      - Tags
    - Special Characters amd Escaping
      - \ to escape non alpha numeric in markdown
      - & to escape HTML
    - Structured Data
      - JSON:
        - Format: {"key": "value"}
        - Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.
      - XML:
          - Similar to HTML, used for data representation.
         - Tags: <tag>value</tag>
      - Unicode
Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII codes", in unicode the name used is "Unicode codepoints"
In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix U+ for example U+21AA is the codepoint for this character: â†ª
Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.
